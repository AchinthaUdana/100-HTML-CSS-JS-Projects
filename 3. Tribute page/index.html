        <p class="animated">
          Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer,
          mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to
          the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply
          system. His innovations in electromagnetism laid the foundation for
          wireless communication and energy.
        </p>
        <p class="animated">
          Tesla held over 300 patents worldwide and his inventions include the
          Tesla coil, induction motor, and wireless transmission of energy.
          Despite his brilliance, he died in relative obscurity, but his legacy
          continues to inspire scientists and engineers today.
